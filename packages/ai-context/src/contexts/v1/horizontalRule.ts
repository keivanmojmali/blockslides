Node: horizontalRule (block group)
Attrs (inherited from BaseBlockAttributes):
- align: "left" | "center" | "right" | "stretch"
- padding: "none" | "sm" | "md" | "lg"
- margin: "none" | "sm" | "md" | "lg"
- backgroundColor: string (CSS color)
- (and other base attributes)

Content:
- No children; this is a self-contained separator.

- Use to visually separate sections within a slide.
- Can control spacing around the rule with padding/margin.
