Sizing
- Slides and flyers share the same JSON. Flyers are slides sized via slide.attrs.size and theme rules.
- Allowed sizes: "16x9" | "4x3" | "a4-portrait" | "a4-landscape" | "letter-portrait" | "letter-landscape" | "linkedin-banner".
- Editors may render with fixed canvases or dynamic mode. The default is fixed; dynamic stretches to container with preserved aspect.
