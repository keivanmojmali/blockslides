export const blockquote = `
Node: blockquote
Attrs:
- HTML-only; no required JSON attrs beyond optional styling such as className.

Content:
- One or more block nodes (typically paragraphs, headings, lists).

Semantics:
- Use for quoted text or callouts inside a column or row.
- Styling should be applied via className on the surrounding column/slide, not by inventing new attrs here.
